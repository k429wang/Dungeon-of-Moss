# Dungeon-of-Moss

Included are the files to a game I created using Visual Basic called Dungeon of Moss.

The gameplay is similar to traditional "bullet-hell" type games, where you must survive for as long as possible whilst dodging enemy attacks. In my game, you control a character who wields a knife, and you must avoid zombies to survive for as long as possibe.

To run the game, download the files, in addition to a Visual Basic compiler, and run the executable .sln file.
